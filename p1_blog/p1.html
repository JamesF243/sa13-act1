      <h2>Baking Babka</h2>
      <p>Posted on March 24, 2024 by James</p>
      <p>Today I made some Cinnamon Babka, which is a Jewish Sweet Bread.
         I used Binging With Babish's recipe, although I did add some cinnamon.
         It was quite good, even if the process was labor intensive

      <h2>Capstone Project Progress</h2>
      <p>Posted on March 29, 2024 by James</p>
      <p>Made some progress on the capstone project finally.
        The processing handoff now works, even if the camera still opens when it shouldn't.
        Wish my teammates would help a bit more though. </p>
